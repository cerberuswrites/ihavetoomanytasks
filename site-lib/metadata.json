The announcement also contains a packet on Sabotage and Subversion of RCA, Security Report which is redacted, but seems to suggest that RCA has identified critical points at which outsiders—including heretics, though the positioning of these redactions suggest...something else, too—are entering onto campus. Notably, RCA states that intruders are using technology such as HEXLIGHT or other advanced, unknown magitech, to mimic the appearance of RCA cadets when operating. This news, more than anything else, shakes the campus. Simmered-down tensions between Federation and Alvaran students threaten to rise again.

Vignette style??more so a matter of citizenship than descent/ethinicity so to speak. tensions are focused on federation vs alvara — students from other countries e.g. medved may not be subject to said restrictions.think it would be interesting if we really incorporated selflessness/pride as themes throughout whatever event we run, whether that be as a dev opportunity or as a way to showcase the way the etc might be perceived by fellow cadets/visiting clergy.lea di merlo — Yesterday at 21:17\nfor fall equinox...... harvest festival! i think it would be fun if there's a tradition of giving away your spring clothes (selflessness) + buying yourself New, fall clothes to wear (pride?) so we could have etc running stalls for donation drives + selling new clothes and other vanity items (maybe lotus tower-provided), can have ppl bargaining and trying to see who can sell the most shit. also can double as a popular gardening club (or any gardener) venue bc they can add their fall harvest to the harvest table (jus a big ass table with incense, lekh, mirrors, and donated fruits/veggies that ppl pray to lol) dead perseise — Yesterday at 21:30\ni think that's brilliant!! it could also give cute tie ins of seniors \"donating\" some of their old stuff to juniors (emotionally repressed religiously significant keepsakes or w/e) i noted this in the doc but i think it could be interesting if we explored the concept of selflessness/pride in how the etc is perceived also ... some cadets/clergy seeing it as a dangerous venture that they're glad someone is taking on (but not them) vs some others thinking it a project born from hubris safi — Yesterday at 21:32\ni think we could probably also do a raffle/fundraiser for some really expensive items some students have,,, dead perseise — Yesterday at 21:33\nwe r raffling off lance's family sword replica safi — Yesterday at 21:33\nall money goes towards loehran charities that are helping with victims off the inquistion\nLMFAO lea di merlo — Yesterday at 21:34\ndia will not suppport this..... but if its advertised as regular charity and then given to victims of the inquisition..... what can she do really... dead perseise — Yesterday at 21:34\ngenerally tho id love to help run the event 👉 👈 am a big fan of creating religious &amp; cultural traditions &amp; seeing how they mesh also you know how the tortoise festival went from charity -&gt; gluttony on nightfall. what if selflessness -&gt; pride change involves like. your best clothes &amp; festive facepaint etcetera ...\nsome interesting hooks potentially with the surveillance-based hooks and prompts within the internships - links wipthe goal of a scene is to change something.\nideally, information is revealed; power shifts between key players; a balance is disrupted. themes are patterns: dots connect, the plot progresses.\na question is asked, setting up the next scene.\nindividual member trailing — why pryde had an anti-alvaran slant in the first place - naturally it's probably because of fed favouring but there's definitely something to sink teeth into here\nAll ETC members must display an allegiance to the Temple—remember the careful line that is being tread. At the same time, use this opportunity to spread awareness of the historical premise and theological precedence of the ETC, especially among visiting clergy. If completed, must be a group thread, ideally a member-run event.\n01 VOLUNTEER FOR THE FALL EQUINOX\nThe boringly human part of predictive, \"artificial\" intelligence—encode hundreds of hours of footage tracking Inquisitors and explaining their movements to help categorize and archive footage. RCA also seems to be allowing some use of their personal surveillance system, or debating merging it with the student-run system If completed, thread must decide if student-collected surveillance will be merged with RCA's or not.\n02 DATA ENTRY\nHow did an organization come to be so compromised? Finish or further investigations into its members, and provide the information, freely and with a display of proactivity, to the Inquisition.\n03 PRYDE CLEANUP I\nThe RCA wants nothing to do with organizations that are exclusive, alumni-funded or powered, or attempt to have secret rituals of faith. The Academy is pushing students instead to seek worship, as is in the Lekh, openly and ardently. You've heard of a certain \"book club\" that needs to be removed.\n04 PRYDE CLEANUP II\n...There are parts of the investigation the RCA believes would be \"unnecessary\" to show the Inquisition. You understand. Get rid of the evidence. Not available to cadets of Alvaran descent.\n05 PRYDE CLEANUP III\nUNTRACEABLE DELETION Inside the halls of the Base, the Inquisition is breathing down the Federation's neck. No solider has been killed yet (or the Federation is doing a great job of hiding it?), but the tension might suffocate them all the same. There are some tasks—removal, deletion, moving things...that are better done by hands the red robes aren't watching as closely. Not available to cadets of Alvaran descent.\n06 UNTRACEABLE DELETION\nTIGHTEN RANKS Not everyone in the ETC can be trusted. As the organization grows, it's important to generate a core committee. Who falls in the actual governing body, and who winds up as more of a standing member? How might they accept new members? What does this \"union of Valkyries\" look like, and how will it run? If completed, thread must name Lance's successor.\n07 TIGHTEN RANKS\nAUDIT MEETINGS The ETC has decided that it will retain its own auditing of public Temple and Lotus Tower meetings, and also have voices therein that can begin sowing pressure against the Temple through legitimate channels of grievance.\n08 AUDIT MEETINGS\nIntruders at RCA. Or wait, are those the students in that smuggling group? It doesn't matter—this checkpoint has to be enforced, they can be taken to campus security, and if they are students, they would just comply. If completed, thread must permanently injure a non-ETC member.\n09 UNAUTHORISED ACCESS","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"PIKE REMOVAL","level":1,"id":"PIKE_REMOVAL_0"},{"heading":"PLANNING / VIGNETTE-STYLE?","level":4,"id":"PLANNING_/_VIGNETTE-STYLE?_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"ADDITIONAL INFORMATION","level":1,"id":"ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION_0"},{"heading":"STRANGE TOKENS, NPC QUEST","level":2,"id":"STRANGE_TOKENS,_NPC_QUEST_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_2"},{"heading":"NOTES ON: THE FUTURE OF THE ETC","level":2,"id":"NOTES_ON_THE_FUTURE_OF_THE_ETC_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_3"},{"heading":"ON: THREAD STYLES","level":2,"id":"ON_THREAD_STYLES_0"},{"heading":"vignettes","level":3,"id":"vignettes_0"},{"heading":"character dev","level":3,"id":"character_dev_0"},{"heading":"traditional turn order","level":3,"id":"traditional_turn_order_0"},{"heading":"round robin","level":3,"id":"round_robin_0"},{"heading":"group ffa","level":3,"id":"group_ffa_0"},{"heading":"SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED!","level":1,"id":"SOMETHING_HAS_HAPPENED!_0"},{"heading":"A STATEMENT RE: STRANGE TOKENS","level":2,"id":"A_STATEMENT_RE_STRANGE_TOKENS_0"},{"heading":"DEVELOPMENT","level":3,"id":"DEVELOPMENT_0"},{"heading":"INVESTIGATIONS INTO 'BOOK CLUB'","level":2,"id":"INVESTIGATIONS_INTO_'BOOK_CLUB'_0"},{"heading":"SMUGGLING GROUP GETS GOT","level":2,"id":"SMUGGLING_GROUP_GETS_GOT_0"},{"heading":"TIMELINE OF EVENTS","level":1,"id":"TIMELINE_OF_EVENTS_0"},{"heading":"NOTES ON: CADETS OF ALVARAN DESCENT","level":2,"id":"NOTES_ON_CADETS_OF_ALVARAN_DESCENT_0"},{"heading":"RE: SCENES","level":1,"id":"RE_SCENES_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_4"},{"heading":"VOLUNTEER FOR THE FALL EQUINOX","level":1,"id":"VOLUNTEER_FOR_THE_FALL_EQUINOX_0"},{"heading":"PLANNING / CHARACTER-DEV","level":4,"id":"PLANNING_/_CHARACTER-DEV_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_5"},{"heading":"DATA ENTRY","level":1,"id":"DATA_ENTRY_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_6"},{"heading":"PRYDE CLEANUP I","level":1,"id":"PRYDE_CLEANUP_I_0"},{"heading":"PLANNING / VIGNETTES","level":4,"id":"PLANNING_/_VIGNETTES_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_7"},{"heading":"PRYDE CLEANUP II","level":1,"id":"PRYDE_CLEANUP_II_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_8"},{"heading":"PRYDE CLEANUP III","level":1,"id":"PRYDE_CLEANUP_III_0"},{"heading":"IN PROGRESS / SEF &amp; ETHE / TRADITIONAL TURN-BASED","level":4,"id":"IN_PROGRESS_/_SEF_&_ETHE_/_TRADITIONAL_TURN-BASED_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_9"},{"heading":"UNTRACEABLE DELETION","level":1,"id":"UNTRACEABLE_DELETION_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_10"},{"heading":"TIGHTEN RANKS","level":1,"id":"TIGHTEN_RANKS_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_11"},{"heading":"AUDIT MEETINGS","level":1,"id":"AUDIT_MEETINGS_0"},{"heading":"","level":1,"id":"_12"},{"heading":"UNAUTHORISED ACCESS","level":1,"id":"UNAUTHORISED_ACCESS_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"index.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1765424506624,"modifiedTime":1765430585007,"sourceSize":12107,"sourcePath":"05 SUNSTRIKE/ETC TASKING/INDEX.canvas","exportPath":"index.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"canvas"},"the-future-of-the-etc.html":{"title":"THE FUTURE OF THE ETC","icon":"","description":" you are able to define what \"leader\" even means or is capable of. think about organizational structures in real life. general members? voting members? who is accountable to who and how?

the desire) w/o worrying abt how leadership affects those picks as well. i have no preference either way. - looked through the member list, and given lance's preferences i listed last time (diplomacy stat highly valued), think he'd be most comfortable with either Ethe Serettis, or Samira Batai. potentially also interested in Sanya Shaw (doesnt know well enough or as well as the first two), Sef
